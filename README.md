These are on seph's personal credit card. But we expect to be inside the free limit

### Setup Process

Useful URLs:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html

The initial boostrapping is manual. It was configured via:
1. Create the AWS org level account. 
  a. Normal AWS signup flow
  b. Convert it to an org level
2. Create new child accounts
3. **IMPORTANT**: For all child accounts, you must set a proper root password and MFA
  a. This requires you go through a forgot password flow.
4. Initial user
  a. An initial `seph-initial` user was created
  b. And granted administrator access
